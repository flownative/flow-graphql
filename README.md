# GraphQL Library for Neos Flow

This [Flow](https://flow.neos.io) package provides a minimal wrapper
around the [webonyx/graphql-php](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php)
package. Rather than providing a big range of features or automagic code
analysis, this library only solves the bare necessary tasks and gets not
into the way between your implementation and the original GraphQL
library.

## Credits and Support

This library was developed by Robert Lemke / Flownative. Feel free to
